UncommonJS is a system for decentralized JavaScript specification
development and consensus gathering, intended to solve the problem of
multiple incoherent efforts going on under the auspices of the
CommonJS brand.  Each fork of UncommonJS represents an individual
contributorâ€™s coherent vision.

These are specifications that I presently support.

-   [Modules Specification](modules/specification)
-   [Packages Specification](packages/specification)
-   [Promises Specification](promises/specification)
-   [Unit Testing Specification](tests/specification)
    -   [Tutorial](tests/tutorial)
