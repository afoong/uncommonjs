UncommonJS
==========

Decentralized JavaScript conventions and API design.  An
opinionated fork of CommonJS.  Fork me to show support, fix,
and extend.

Specifications are developed in separate directories and
eponymous branches.  These are merged one-way into a master
branch to provide the whole picture.  I encourage
participants to create their own master branch that only
merges the specifications that they are tracking and
approve.
